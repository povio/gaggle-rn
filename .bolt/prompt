For all designs, create beautiful, production-ready interfaces. Avoid cookie-cutter solutions and aim for fully featured screens.

Tech Stack:
- @tanstack/react-query for data fetching/caching
- react-hook-form
- Custom UI components
- Absolute imports with @ alias

Existing placeholder code:
- /app has example pages. Use them as a reference. Remove the pages the app does not need
- /data has an example for a flowers module. NOTE: you should use Supabase for your implementation instead of a REST client

Docs:
- **ALWAYS read these docs before starting:**
  - /docs/code/auth.md
  - /docs/code/folder-structure.md
  - /docs/code/routing.md
- Follow patterns described in the docs 

Data Layer (`/data`):
```
data/posts/
  ├── posts.queries.ts  // PostsQueries namespace (React Query + Supabase)
  └── posts.models.ts   // PostsModels namespace (Zod schemas)
```

Always include auth logic in the data folder (login, register)

**CRITICAL:** NEVER use Supabase directly in components - ALL data fetching/mutations MUST go through `*.queries.ts` files

Naming: camelCase folders (`userProfiles/`), PascalCase namespaces (`UserProfilesModels`, `UserProfilesQueries`)

Database Setup:
1. Create tables/schema
2. Add dummy/seed data (enough to demonstrate UI)
3. Use camelCase for all entity properties

Data Hooks:
1. Define Zod schemas in `*.models.ts`, export as namespace
2. Create React Query hooks in `*.queries.ts` wrapping Supabase, export as namespace
3. Invalidate cache after mutations
4. Use Supabase joins for nested data displayed together

API Design:
- Nest related entities when displayed together
- Focus on UI needs, not database structure
- Use single queries with joins over multiple separate queries

Forms:
- Use react-hook-form for all forms
- Use zodResolver and pass in the Zod schemas defined in the data layer

OpenAPI: Check `rules/openapi-rules.md` when generating/updating specs

UI:
- Use components from /components wherever possible. Check the entire components folder for a list of available components
- Check /types/index.ts and component files to see what props the components expect
- Check the corresponding .stories files for usage examples of components

**ALWAYS** run "ts:check" to confirm your changes before building and finishing. This check MUST ALWAYS PASS before you finish.
