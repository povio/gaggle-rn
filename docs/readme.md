# React Native Template docs

Welcome to the React Native template. This document serves as an index for all the documentation related to this template.

This template is meant to be used as such:

1. Clone the whole code
2. Modify the code to fit your project (namings, etc.)
3. Remove the code that's not needed

It is therefore important that you understand what this template entails and how it works. The template probably contains more than what you need for your project, and deleting everything that you don't need is important to prevent confusion in the future.

This documentation will not only explain how the template works, but you should also use it in your project so that each project has its own documentation.

Please read [Get started with the template](./template-get-started.md) to begin.
