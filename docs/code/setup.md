# Setup

Learn how to setup and run the project.

## Editor setup

If you are using VSCode, we suggest you install recommended extensions (inside `.vscode/extensions.json`). The IDE should prompt you to install them when opening the project.

## Running

React Native template runs in the [Expo Go application](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/), which is the easiest way to get started with Expo. Expo is a open-source framework for apps that builds on top of the React Native ecosystem.

```bash
